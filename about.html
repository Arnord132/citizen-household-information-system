   The Citizen Household Information Collection System is a digital platform developed to help the government collect accurate and up-to-date information about citizens and their households. This system is part of a national effort to improve service delivery, planning, and resource allocation in various sectors such as health, education, housing, and social protection.

Through this system, citizens can register their household details, including:

The number of family members

A photo and identity of the household head

The household’s standard of living

This information helps local authorities and government agencies to better understand the needs of the population and provide targeted support where it is most needed. The system is user-friendly, secure, and accessible to everyone, ensuring that no citizen is left behind in the data collection process.

All the data collected is handled with strict privacy and confidentiality measures and is used only for official purposes. The platform is managed by the Ministry of Local Government in collaboration with local districts and ICT partners.
